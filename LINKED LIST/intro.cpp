Node is a custom defined data type

/*conversion of array to ll

TO CONVERT A ARRAY TO LL:-
we use three pointers of data type Node to implement LL in array

the value stored by Node is "data", the address is stored by Node is "next"( var name )

nodes are formed using new operator and parametrised constructor
newly formed nodes always stores null as address

head:- it always points to first Node of LL, advised not to change it's address

mover:- it points to Node previous to newly formed Node and changes Node's(previous Node's)
stored address to the next Node, and then moves to the next Node
initially mover points to first Node

temp:- it points to the newly formed Node, so that mover can move to to the newly formed Node
after changing stored address of previous Node

the function returns  head, which can be used to do various thing with the converted
array
